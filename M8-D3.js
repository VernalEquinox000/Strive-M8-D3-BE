/*  # All about Token Based Auth

  Now its time to add auth to your medium project!


  ## Frontend 

  Create the register & login page for the project.

  When the users insert the credentials, test them out to see if the provided credentials are valid. (dont use alert anymore pls!, use proper components from bootstrap)

  After successful login, store the credentials and redirect user to homepage.

  Authorized user should see his/her articles and only they should be able to edit their articles.



 ## BackEnd
 Add token based auth to your previous backend. 
 Create in your database a "user" collection with username and password, using the right tool to hash passwords.

 Create a service test with two endpoints:
     - Register (username, password): creates a new valid user
     - Login: returns a token for access API
     - Enable Authorization on the other endpoints making them available only to registered users


 [EXTRA]

 Implement refresh token technique */
